# üö¥ My V√©lo Mate ‚Äì Real-Time Cycling Monitor

Commercial physiological monitoring systems for exercise testing are often **expensive, complex, or inaccessible for student research and DIY sports science**. In particular, **portable real-time VO‚ÇÇ monitoring** is rare and typically requires proprietary equipment.

üß† **My V√©lo Mate** addresses this gap by providing a **low-cost, Raspberry Pi-based solution** capable of tracking:
- O‚ÇÇ and CO‚ÇÇ concentration
- Respiratory flow
- VO‚ÇÇ, VCO‚ÇÇ, RER, VE, and VO‚ÇÇMAX in real-time

It combines **multithreaded Qt architecture**, **event-driven callbacks**, and **modular sensor integration** to create a fully functional, extensible monitoring system.

**Key use cases include**:
- Lab-based aerobic capacity testing (VO‚ÇÇMAX)
- DIY fitness and cycling experiments
- Academic/engineering teaching demonstrations

This project brings powerful physiological monitoring capabilities to **students, makers, and sports engineers**, with a fully open-source implementation.

## üß∞ Hardware Setup

This project integrates **three sensors**, all connected to the Raspberry Pi via I¬≤C interface:

| Sensor        | Model       | Description                                  | Manufacturer             |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| O‚ÇÇ Sensor     | **4MZ-HH**  | Measures oxygen concentration (%)         | Ê≤≥ÂçóÂçéÊ∑±ÁßëÊô∫ËÉΩÁßëÊäÄÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏  |
| CO‚ÇÇ Sensor    | **Sensirion SCD4x** | Measures CO‚ÇÇ concentration (%)| [[Sensirion SCD4x Datasheet](https://developer.sensirion.com/product-support/scd4x-co2-sensor)] |
| Flow Sensor   | **Sensirion SFM3300** | Measures respiratory gas flow in L/min     | [Sensirion SFM3300 Datasheet](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SFM3300-D)

> All sensors communicate over the Raspberry Pi‚Äôs I¬≤C bus.

> üõ†Ô∏è You‚Äôll also need a **breathing mask with a one-way valve** to ensure proper gas flow measurement.  
> Since no suitable commercial product was available, **we designed and DIYed a custom mask** for this project.

## üöÄ How to Reproduce This Project

You can easily run the full system by following these steps:

### 1. üîå Connect the sensors to your Raspberry Pi

![f545e347b242b5af3ac7fd1eb3bed17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc9e7403-7c98-409d-ae2a-43eb425400ee)

### 2. üì¶ Download the Source Code Package

We provide a `.zip` file which contains all the Qt source files. Download and unzip the package.

> The release `.zip` is available in the (https://github.com/WeiyuanWang0821/Real-Time-Cycling-Monitor/releases/tag/V1.0).

### 3. üß± Open in Qt Creator

1. Launch Qt Creator on your Raspberry Pi
2. Click **File ‚Üí Open File or Project**
3. Select the `exp3.pro` file inside the extracted folder

### 4. ‚öôÔ∏è Build and Run

- Make sure your Raspberry Pi has `wiringPi` and I¬≤C enabled (`sudo raspi-config`)
- Click **Build** then **Run** in Qt
- The application window will open and start collecting real-time data

> If I¬≤C devices are not detected, try `i2cdetect -y 1` to verify connections.

### üë£ How to Use

1. **Set basic information**: Input your weight, age, and sex, then click `SET`.
2. Wait for a few seconds for the system to initialize and start sampling.
3. **Select curves** on the left (O‚ÇÇ, CO‚ÇÇ, flow, VO‚ÇÇ...) to visualize in real time.
4. The lower table will dynamically update calculated values, including **VO‚ÇÇ**, **VCO‚ÇÇ**, **VE**, **RER**, and **VO‚ÇÇMAX**.

This marks the start of your **VO‚ÇÇMAX monitoring** during real-time exercise testing.

## üí∏ Sensor Cost & Limitations

- Excluding the Raspberry Pi, the total hardware cost (3 sensors) is **around ¬£200**.
- Due to budget constraints, the **CO‚ÇÇ sensor** used in this project is an **electrochemical model**, which:
  - Has low precision
  - Responds slowly (theoretical delay ~60 seconds)
  - Is **not suitable** for real-time exercise CO‚ÇÇ tracking

However, **CO‚ÇÇ is not required for VO‚ÇÇMAX calculation**, only for **VCO‚ÇÇ-related metrics** like RER.

‚ö†Ô∏è In future versions, we plan to upgrade to a better CO‚ÇÇ sensor.  
Feel free to try replacing it if you're interested in exploring improved accuracy.
