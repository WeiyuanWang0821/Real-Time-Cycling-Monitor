# Real-Time-Cycling-Monitor // My VÃ©lo Mate
# Our project aims to develop equipment that provides professional data support for cycling enthusiasts at a low cost.
# By monitoring heart rate, power, and respiratory data, the system processes multiple threads in real-time and visualizes key metrics such as average power and VO2 as curve graphs on the screen.
